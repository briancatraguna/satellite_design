# Satellite Design Project

As part of my study in the Aerospace Engineering Program, I had the satellite design course. In the project, I was in charge of
the control systems of the satellite. As a result, I made the satellite dynamics model in Simulink along with the help of the animations created by
my lecturers and contributors in MathWorks.
